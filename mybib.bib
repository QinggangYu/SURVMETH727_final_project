abstract = {Although the individualism-collectivism dimension is usually examined in a U.S. versus Asian context, there is variation within the United States. The authors created an eight-item index ranking states in terms of collectivist versus individualist tendencies. As predicted, collectivist tendencies were strongest in the Deep South, and individualist tendencies were strongest in the Mountain West and Great Plains. In Part 2, convergent validity for the index was obtained by showing that state collectivism scores predicted variation in individual attitudes, as measured by a national survey. In Part 3, the index was used to explore the relationship between individualism-collectivism and a variety of demographic, economic, cultural, and health-related variables. The index may be used to complement traditional measures of collectivism and individualism and may be of use to scholars seeking a construct to account for unique U.S. regional variation.},

abstract = {Prior evidence suggests that external threat motivates people to monitor norm violations. However, the effect of threat may be attenuated for those high in interdependent self-construal (SC) because this SC affords a sense of protection against the threat. Here, we tested this possibility by priming or not priming young American adults with a pathogen threat. We then had participants read norm-violating or normal behaviors while assessing two electrocortical markers: N400 (indexing the detection of norm violations) and suppression of upper $\alpha$-band power (indexing vigilance to the violations). In the threat priming condition, interdependent SC predicted decreased responsiveness to norm violations. In the control priming condition, however, interdependent SC predicted increased responsiveness. Our work suggests that interdependent SC may provide a sense of security under threat.},

@article{Markus1991,
abstract = {People in different cultures have strikingly different construals of the self, of others, and of the interdependence of the 2. These construals can influence, and in many cases determine, the very nature of individual experience, including cognition, emotion, and motivation. Many Asian cultures have distinct conceptions of individuality that insist on the fundamental relatedness of individuals to each other. The emphasis is on attending to others, fitting in, and harmonious interdependence with them. American culture neither assumes nor values such an overt connectedness among individuals. In contrast, individuals seek to maintain their independence from others by attending to the self and by discovering and expressing their unique inner attributes. As proposed herein, these construals are even more powerful than previously imagined. Theories of the self from both psychology and anthropology are integrated to define in detail the difference between a construal of the self as independent and a construal of the self as interdependent. Each of these divergent construals should have a set of specific consequences for cognition, emotion, and motivation; these consequences are proposed and relevant empirical literature is reviewed. Focusing on differences in self-construals enables apparently inconsistent empirical findings to be reconciled, and raises questions about what have been thought to be culture-free aspects of cognition, emotion, and motivation.},

@article{Fincher2008,
abstract = {<p> Pathogenic diseases impose selection pressures on the social behaviour of host populations. In humans ( <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> ), many psychological phenomena appear to serve an antipathogen defence function. One broad implication is the existence of cross-cultural differences in human cognition and behaviour contingent upon the relative presence of pathogens in the local ecology. We focus specifically on one fundamental cultural variable: differences in individualistic versus collectivist values. We suggest that specific behavioural manifestations of collectivism (e.g. ethnocentrism, conformity) can inhibit the transmission of pathogens; and so we hypothesize that collectivism (compared with individualism) will more often characterize cultures in regions that have historically had higher prevalence of pathogens. Drawing on epidemiological data and the findings of worldwide cross-national surveys of individualism/collectivism, our results support this hypothesis: the regional prevalence of pathogens has a strong positive correlation with cultural indicators of collectivism and a strong negative correlation with individualism. The correlations remain significant even when controlling for potential confounding variables. These results help to explain the origin of a paradigmatic cross-cultural difference, and reveal previously undocumented consequences of pathogenic diseases on the variable nature of human societies. </p>},

@article{Eisenberger2007,
abstract = {It is well established that a lack of social support constitutes a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality, comparable to risk factors such as smoking, obesity, and high blood pressure. Although it has been hypothesized that social support may benefit health by reducing physiological reactivity to stressors, the mechanisms underlying this process remain unclear. Moreover, to date, no studies have investigated the neurocognitive mechanisms that translate experiences of social support into the health outcomes that follow. To investigate these processes, thirty participants completed three tasks in which daily social support, neurocognitive reactivity to a social stressor, and neuroendocrine responses to a social stressor were assessed. Individuals who interacted regularly with supportive individuals across a 10-day period showed diminished cortisol reactivity to a social stressor. Moreover, greater social support and diminished cortisol responses were associated with diminished activity in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and Brodmann's area (BA) 8, regions previously associated with the distress of social separation. Lastly, individual differences in dACC and BA 8 reactivity mediated the relationship between high daily social support and low cortisol reactivity, such that supported individuals showed reduced neurocognitive reactivity to social stressors, which in turn was associated with reduced neuroendocrine stress responses. This study is the first to investigate the neural underpinnings of the social support-health relationship and provides evidence that social support may ultimately benefit health by diminishing neural and physiological reactivity to social stressors. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Park2014,
abstract = {The fundamentally social nature of humans is revealed in their exquisitely high sensitivity to potentially negative evaluations held by others. At present, however, little is known about neurocortical correlates of the response to such social-evaluative threat. Here, we addressed this issue by showing that mere exposure to an image of a watching face is sufficient to automatically evoke a social-evaluative threat for those who are relatively high in interdependent self-construal. Both European American and Asian participants performed a flanker task while primed with a face (vs control) image. The relative increase of the error-related negativity (ERN) in the face (vs control) priming condition became more pronounced as a function of interdependent (vs independent) self-construal. Relative to European Americans, Asians were more interdependent and, as predicted, they showed a reliably stronger ERN in the face (vs control) priming condition. Our findings suggest that the ERN can serve as a robust empirical marker of self-threat that is closely modulated by socio-cultural variables. {\textcopyright} The Author (2012).},

abstract = {Effects of isolation on mood and relationships in pregnant women during the covid-19 pandemic Dear Editor, We note that COVID-19 is a global public health emergency that has resulted in a significant psychological impact on the mental health of women during pregnancy [1]. There has been emerging evidence of further secondary morbidity associated with the pandemic with an in increase in domestic violence associated with the strategies implemented to slow its spread, namely social isolation and lockdown [2]. There is a known increased risk of domestic violence in pregnancy [3]. We sought to assess the effects of lockdown on relationships and maternal mood. We carried out a prospective study involving pregnant women attending for antenatal care in The Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, a tertiary level maternity centre in Dublin. Women in their second and third trimesters completed a questionnaire in the outpatient setting which was based on maternal mood during the lockdown phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to details of relationships between partners, family and friends during this time. From 6th April to the 28th April 2020, 70 women completed the questionnaire (Table 1). This represented the latter period of "total lockdown" in Ireland with restrictions including an exercise limit of two kilometres from home and all other journeys outside to be made only for provision of essential services or to purchase essential goods. Most women (67/70; 95.7 %) reported the relationship with their partner had not deteriorated over this time with 4.3 % (3/70) reporting a deterioration. Of this group, one woman thought of seeking help in the form of police action (33 %;1/3). Of those whose relationships had not deteriorated, 34 % (23/67) have grown closer to their partners, with 21 % (14/67) exercising together, and 28 % (19/67) undertaking shared tasks at home. 34 % (24/70) of women reported improving relationships with family and friends by communicating with them more frequently. However, 11 % (8/70) stated that there were tensions between family members/children who were also in isolation in the same household. When questioned on mood, 44 % (31/70) reported low mood due to loneliness as they missed contact with friends and family. Anxiety was reported due to financial pressure due to being unable to work in 14 % (10/70). Positively, over one third of women (34 %; 24/70) said they were enjoying the lockdown and isolation as it was relaxing and a break from life's fast pace.},

abstract = {<p>The COVID-19 epidemic adversely affects the lifestyle of people. This study aimed to examine the impacts of social isolation on physical activity (PA) levels and mood states of children and adolescents and to explore the correlation between them during the COVID-19 epidemic. A total of 9979 children and adolescents (11.63 ± 1.23 years old) from Yan'an, China volunteered to participate in this study and completed online questionnaires. PA and mood states were measured by International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form (IPAQ-SF) and Profile of Mood States (POMS), respectively. The results showed that the mean of students' moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) was 23.19 min per day. The total mood disturbance in the moderate and high-level PA groups were significantly lower than those in the low-level PA group (p < 0.05). Additionally, boys and girls had significant differences in PA levels (p < 0.01), and the PA levels of students in different grades were also significantly different (p < 0.01). Meanwhile, boys' mood states were worse than girls'. The Grade 4 in primary schools had the worst mood states while Grade 5 had the best mood states. The results suggested that the MVPA of students has dropped badly, compared with the results of previous studies investigated in normal times. In addition, the PA level had a significantly positive impact on the mood states of children and adolescents during the COVID-19 epidemic. Sex and grades were factors which affected the PA levels and mood states. This study can help policymakers and healthcare professionals understand PA and mood states of Chinese children and adolescents during the epidemic. We should pay attention to the changes in PA levels and mood states of children and adolescents.</p>},

abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in more than half the world's population being placed in lockdown to stem the spread of the virus. The severe restrictions imposed in many nations had the potential to significantly influence the physical and psychological well-being of those affected. The aim of the current study was to investigate mood responses during the period of restrictions from March to June, 2020. Mood responses of 1,062 participants (386 male, 676 female) were collected using the Brunel Mood Scale, hosted on the In The Mood website www.moodprofiling.com. The mean pattern of mood responses reflected an inverse iceberg profile, characterized by significantly elevated scores for tension, depression, anger, fatigue, and confusion, and below average scores for vigor; a profile associated with increased risk of mental health issues. Females reported more negative mood scores than males. Participants in the ≤25 age group reported the most negative profiles whereas those in the ≥56 age group reported the least negative profiles. Mood differences related to education status were also evident. Finally, mood scores fluctuated over time, with profiles being most negative during April and June. Overall, results confirmed significant mood disturbance during the period of COVID-19 restrictions, representing increased risk of psychopathology.},
